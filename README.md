# Cobblemon Stats Mod

A Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 that adds extra statistics for Cobblemon trainers!  
Track your progress with new custom stats such as Pok√©mon caught, shinies encountered, trades completed, and more.

## ‚ú® Features

- **New Cobblemon Statistics**:
  - Shiny Pok√©mon caught
  - Pok√©mon caught  
  - Pok√©mon registered in Pok√©dex  
  - Battles won (PVP)  
  - Pok√©mon reel (fishing rod)  
  - Trades completed  
- **Scoreboard Integration**: Use Minecraft‚Äôs `/scoreboard` system to display and track these stats.  
- **Configurable**: JSON-based configuration file to toggle which events broadcast to chat.  
- **Lightweight**: No extra items or mechanics ‚Äî just pure stat tracking.

## üéÆ How it Works

The mod listens to Cobblemon events (catching, battling, trading, fishing, etc.) and increments corresponding custom Minecraft stats.  
These stats can be accessed through:

- The **Statistics menu** (ESC ‚Üí Statistics)  
- The **Scoreboard system** with `/scoreboard objectives`  

For example:

```mcfunction
/scoreboard objectives add shinyCaught minecraft.custom:scoremons.shiny_caught
/scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar shinyCaught
```

This will show all players‚Äô shiny catches in the sidebar.
